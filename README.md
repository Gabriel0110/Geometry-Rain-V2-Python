# Geometry-Rain-V2-Python
I recreated my Geometry Rain game in Python that I initially made with Unity in C#.  The main reason for this is to train Reinforcement Learning agents using various algorithms to play the game and see how well they learn to play it.

I haven't separated the classes into their own files yet, so you can simply install the necessary library (Arcade) and run the geometry_rain.py file.
