# Geometry-Rain-V2-Python
I recreated my Geometry Rain game in Python that I initially made with Unity in C#.  The main reason for this is to more easily train Reinforcement Learning agents using various algorithms to play the game and see how well they learn to play it.  I'll likely use OpenAI Gym to create my own environment of the game.

I haven't separated the classes into their own files yet, so you can simply install the necessary library (Arcade) and run the geometry_rain.py file.

Video demo to come soon.
